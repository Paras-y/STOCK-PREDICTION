# STOCK-PREDICTION
This project is a part of The Sparks Foundation GRIP internship which highlights time series analysis of historical stock prices and sentimental analysis of news headlines.
The historical stock prices of Tesla Motots dataset has been extracted from https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA/history?period1=1465430400&period2=1623196800&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true
and the news headlines data is used from 'https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t='.
I have used Auto-ARIMA model to make stock market prices predictions using the historical stock prices data. In the sentiment analysis model, I have made use Natural language processing ( NLTK is used for everything from splitting sentences from paragraphs, splitting up words, recognizing the part of speech of those words, highlighting the main subjects, and then even with helping your machine to understand what the text is all about.)
